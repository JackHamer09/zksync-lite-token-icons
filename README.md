# zkSync Lite token icons
In this repository you can find a [compiled json file](https://github.com/JackHamer09/zksync-lite-token-icons/blob/main/tokens-icons.json) with icons for the most tokens that are [currently supported](https://zkscan.io/explorer/tokens) on zkSync Lite. Each token has 3 sizes "thumb" (25x25), "small" (50x50) and "large" (250x250). The icons are hosted by [coingecko.com](coingecko.com). The list of icons was compiled by combining all available tokens from the [zkSync Lite token list](https://zkscan.io/explorer/tokens) and the [coingecko token list](https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/list).
